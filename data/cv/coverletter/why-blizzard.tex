\lettersection{Why Blizzard?}

Because you are the best video game company in the world. 

Except this point, I love the way you are approching the development of video games. You are, each time, building a unique experience with the need to produce the best games.

You are creating games that change the world, make people happier, and you are providing unique feeling to us, players. I want to be a part of this, I want to help you archive those goals.

Also, you've wrote down the core values of your company, which means those one are important to you, and those core values are what make your company great. You are not just commit to ceate the best gameplay or publish a game when it's done; but you also focus on your employees by helping them to learn and grow. Those values are what I'm looking for in a company, values not only focusing on building great things but also on help people to be better.

I went to my first BlizzCon last year and this was just a plain confirmation of the fact that I want to work at Blizzard. I had the chance to met Rachelle Davis. It was only for 5 minutes but it confirms to me how good you are and how good the working culture at Blizzard is. 

During this BlizzCon, I've also assist to two panels that confort me in why I wanted to join you. The first one was \emph{Life at Blizzard: Career & Culture Insights} 

Finally, you are working with the best software engineer and I want to be part of them and learn from them.
