\lettersection{Why the Corporate Applications team?}

When we are playing your video games, we usally don't think about the tools used by the company every day but those tools have an important part of why Blizzard can work like is doing and produce those fantastic games.

What your team is doing is what I love to do, building application to help others to perform at their best level and I want to help you archive this goal.

You are using technologies that I love and even if I can change the one I'm using, especially if a better one is available for the task I need to perform, continue to work in .NET.
