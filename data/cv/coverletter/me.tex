\lettersection{About Me}

I've always been pationated about computer and gaming. The first time that I've touched a computer was a revelation. So much possibility in a so small box. At first, it was mainly to play video games but soon, I've wanted to find more and understand how the computer was working.

The, I've started to program by starting to learn C then Pascal and Delphi. After this, I've learned C\# and I fell in love with the beauty and power of this language. Not so long ago, I've started to learn C++ as I through it was a fun language to learn with a lot of possibility. 

Around May 2005, I've discover a game that change my life, World of Warcraft. I've playde various games (RTS, FPS, RPG) but this game had something different. Since then, I've never really stop to play it even if I've played other games too. 

Outside computers and gaming, I'm living in Belgium, near Namur with my soon-to-be wife and our rabbit, Jaina. Two and half years ago, I've started to follow night classes to OBTEIN a CS degree.
