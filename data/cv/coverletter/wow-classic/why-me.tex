I'm an hard worker, I always do my best to help the team archive is goal and to succeed. I love to learn new skills in computer science and never stop to read or practice to improve my craft.

I'm open minded, if someone have an idea on how to complete a task, I want to heard it because I know that in every case, what this person will tell me will IMPROVE me.
