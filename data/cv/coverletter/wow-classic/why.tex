\lettersection{Why the WoW Classic team?}

As I've wrote in the \emph{About Me} section, I've started to play at World of Warcraft during Vanilla and this game change my life. I met people I would have probably never met without this game, and I've got so much memories from WoW Vanilla that this game is a part of me.

WoW Classic is bringing back this experience and I want to help you bring the experience of this game to the wider possible audiance. Bring back the emotion I've got when I saw Ragnaros for the first time, put down Nefarian at the top of BWL or simply run accros STRANGLERONCE with the hope to not cross the path of an Horde player (For the Alliance!). But I also want new player to experience the LOST DIPLOMAT quest which is one of the best quests I ever done.

You are bringing back all this and I want to help you do it.
