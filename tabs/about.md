Hi! My name is Cédric, and I’m a programmer. 

## Me
I’ve begun to play with a computer when I had around 5 or 6 years old. At first, it was clicking here and there or trying to use MS-DOS then, playing some games like Stunts or Low Blow. It was a huge discovery, but I soon needed to open and check what was inside this awesome box. 

Soon after, I’ve started to learn how to develop on a computer, and once again, it could not have to imagine how it was.

Around 2005, I’ve started to play a game that changes my life, World of Warcraft. This game was just an endless pleasure with so much to do and so many people to meet. Since then, I never really stop to play this game, and it just still pure fun.

While playing this game, I knew that I wanted to work for the company behind this game, so one day, with all the talented people in this company, I could also change the world a little bit.

## My work
I’ve started to work as a programmer back in 2013 as a .NET developer. In the beginning, I’ve worked, during the first year, on building design and features with the DotNetNuke CMS.

Following this first year, I’ve started to teach for long term training for jobseekers. Mains topics I gave were an introduction to object-oriented development, .NET development, and web development. Providing those training was beneficial for me, explain technical subjects to beginner help you understand them more in-depth.

After almost two years to teach, I’ve started to work for Magotteaux. In this company, I’ve built an internal tool to help them schedule their productions. It was quite challenging as the application had to handle a large amount of data and display them in a single web view. During this period, I had the chance to work with great colleagues, learn a lot from them and bring some ideas to improve the structure of the various internal projects but also the technologies used in them.

Beginning of 2019, I’ve moved to a new company, Actiris, to work, at first, as a frontend developer, but I’ve quickly progressed to be a more polyvalent one. I’m still working with web technologies (mainly Angular), but I’m also building some server-side API with .NET Core. I’m glad that I’m still working sometimes in C# as it’s a language I like a lot.
