## Experience
### Wavenet
#### Internal project
When I've started to work for Wavenet, my firsts task was to integrate design and build features in the DotNetNuke CMS. 

#### Trainer
During almost two years, I've taught basic and more advanced training on .NET and Web development. As the public of those training was various, I had to adapt my explanation to be sure that everyone understood the subject. 

Finally, I've improved my _soft skills_ as I had to present and speak in front of a class, which was not something I used to.

#### Magotteaux
In 2015, I started to work as a consultant for Magotteaux. I've worked for almost three years on two projects. The first one was a web application to help their plants to schedule the production based on the order they had. Those orders were stored in SAP, and with SOAP services, we had to retrieve the information to display them in the web application.
â€¨The application was developed with a backend in C#. The frontend was in JavaScript, for which we use the Knockout library.

It was the biggest project I had to work on and with a lot of impact on the company.

The second project I've worked on is an application for the customer of the company. The app was created to help them followed the orders they placed. It was also connected with SAP and was build for the backend still with C#, but for the frontend, we used Vue.js and TypeScript.

During this period, I probably had the best team leader we can have. He was open-minded, always want the best for you and push you to challenge yourself.

#### Actiris
I've started to work for Actiris at the beginning of 2019. In this company, I'm working on two applications. 

The first one is an internal application to handle the changes in the employee's information and update them in the Active Directory. This application is built in C# for the API and in Angular for the frontend.

The second one is to create and manage events host by the company. On this application, I'm only working on the frontend side, for which we use Angular.

## Working with
.NET Framework and .NET Core, Entity Framework, SQL, HTML, CSS and SCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, Vue.js

## Education
### UNamur : 2017 - now
In 2017, I started to follow classes at the University of Namur (Belgium) mainly to have more theoretical knowledge. Those classes are given the evening, so I'm following them after work.  
Those classes gave me a more structural way to think and helped me to be a better programmer.**
