## GitHub Pages and Jekyll

This blog is host on GitHub Pages as, in my views, it is one of the easiest way to host a static site. You just need to create a repository named <username>.github.io and that's it, you've got your website.

You can, of course, host your own website but if you just want to blog, like myself, you can use Jekyll. With it, you don't need any databse to host your content, you just have to create a markdown file by post you c
want to write and that's it. If you already know the markdown syntax, it will be very easy for you to write.

The only specific part in this file link to Jekyll is the information about the post itself that are at the top of the file. For thie one, I've added this :

```

title: "Welcome Home"
date: 2020-01-21 18:00:00 +0100
categories: [Blogging]
tags: [writing]
---
```

So, you've got the title, the date of the publication, the main and sub-categories and finaly some tags.
